Reproducibility of your code is important, in order to avoid random guessing. Winners will be announced shortly after the end of the game and will be awarded with coupons of Holy Cow. We will not only consider the final prediction you submitted but also the accuracy/loss of your ML model. You might be invited to later share your method with the community if you've done an amazing job."
