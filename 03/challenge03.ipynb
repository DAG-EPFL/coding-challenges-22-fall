While a simple Google Search would probably provide you with some valuable information, you decide to complicate things a bit and use another search engine: [lexica.art](lexica.art), the search engine of [Stable Diffusion] text-image pairs.\n",

    "* For web scraping: a [cool library](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and some more [information](https://lexica.art/docs) about lexica.art\n",
